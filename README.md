#### To do (personal)

- Update the projects, and testimonials and other personal information ‚è≥
- Add more styles/colours if required ‚ùì
- Add a footer/to navbar,socials(linktree,linkedin,github) and other stuff if required ‚úîÔ∏è
- Add a scroll-to-top button(optional) ‚úîÔ∏è
- Fix touch scroll for mobiles due to canvas ‚ùå

#### The 3js webgl of ballcanvas had to be replaced because there were too many canvas and it was not supporting phone devices. - Added useEffect, u will see icosahedronGeometry sphere balls in devices width 768px and above, and normal circular divs in smaller devices

#### No resolve found for WebGL Canvas limit of 16 at once in browsers üòî

#### FIX: Kept the technologies at max 12 so limit is not exceeded.
